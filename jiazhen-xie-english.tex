\section{Projects}

\subsection{Build a new engineer team to deliver a subscription platform}

Gousto solution is on a mission to explore tech SaaS opportunity. I am the tech lead/EM in the team. The project has been scoped for 77 development weeks. My responsibilities and contributions to the project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identified the skill gap in the team and hire.
    \item Work with recruitment team to hire engineers.
    \item Successfully established the way of working for the new team. Build the trust and standard for the Gousto Solution team.
    \item Collaborated with other TLs/EMs on scoping out the platform functionalities. Estimated and budget the project.
    \item Supported sales by building demos for AI modules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lead and replaced a more than 10 years Uswitch system}
Uswitch has a custom and complex back-office system. It leads to huge operating costs and does not allow good products to be launched on the site. After careful research, I verified the importance of the problem and the project's return to the stakeholders. Finally got the commitment to abandon the complex system and the support of the leadership team. I introduced a standard solution for the company. Then I led a group of nine people across departments to deliver. My responsibilities and contributions to the project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Articulated the business problem and received buy-ins from business and other team leads.
    \item Plan and proposed the minimum achievable goals, organised the project process to run the project.
    \item Successfully lead the platform team, delegated tasks and delivered the project on time.
    \item Retired the ten years old complex system, rolling out a standard design to the whole company.
    \item Reduced the operational cost by \$68K per annual.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lead and deliver the Uswitch address level network speed check back-end service for UK users}
The project is a massive project to Uswitch, but the full technical details are uncertain and vague. I used the official documentation and the final project vision, designed the backend architecture. Then led a team of five, including two juniors and two mid-level engineers, to complete the project successfully.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed the robust backend system, created milestones.
    \item Successfully lead the team, delegated tasks and mentored them, received well appreciation.
    \item Delivered the project on time.
    \item Ensured cost-effectivity. E.g., reduce an existing infrastructure cost from \$2K per month to \$300 per month.
    \item Worked with different disciplines. One of the projects generated \textsterling17K in revenue.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use machine learning to label Dressipi's clothing products automatically}
Dressipi, a company that offers personalised fashion recommendations, has to hire an entire team of 20 stylists to label clothes. Stylists can identify many tags from the image. This project uses the machine learning model to automatically learn the features of images and product texts to classify the fashion features of clothing automatically. This project combines data science and software engineering, which I completed independently and put into the production environment. My responsibilities and contributions to the project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sciki-Learn is used to study and experiment the image recognition technology.
    \item Successfully realised the primary colour extraction of the image by the back-end system and successfully carried out feature extraction of the text.
    \item The whole system is implemented end-to-end and has been approved by the entire designer team.
    \item 82\% overall prediction accuracy, up from 65\% previously.
    \item Integrate automatic labelling processes into existing systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dressipi fashion outfit service API performance optimisation}
The Dressipi API is used by many partners' Web applications and mobile applications (e.g. John Lewis, M\&S). It used to take more than 80 queries to find the right match in a single request. I reduced the number of queries by 30\% by improving the custom Elastic Search plugin and Elastic Search queries by analysing the API time and code. My responsibilities and contributions to the project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintain and develop APIs for use by all applications.
    \item Successfully implemented an elastic search plugin and improved runtime performance by 50\%.
    \item Maintain our core application as DevOps in AWS.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scribe - a scalable email rendering service}
Venntro Media Group's email service is a considerable engagement service for the company. The goal of Scribe is to move all of the rendering logic into a single application, using a standard template language (with features like layouts and parts), and keeping the templates and code in the same Git repository. The entire system architecture uses an event-driven architecture. My responsibilities and contributions to the project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented the core Scribe and made the most significant contribution to the library.
    \item Improved performance to enable Scribe to render 300 messages per second.
    \item Increased email engagement by 12\%.
    \item Implement A/B testing framework in Scribe.
    \item Implement the cache system in Scribe.
    \item Use StatSD and Graphiti to monitor performance and conversion rates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implement Wirecard payment gateway}

Venntro Media Group wants to switch our payment gateway from Sagepay to Wirecard with a fixed deadline. As a team, we completed the project one week before the deadline. From a QA perspective, I use BDD to automate payments. The automated payment test dramatically helps regression testing and gives perfect confidence.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the test plan and implement the test cases.
    \item Manage project milestones, complete each milestone and deliver on schedule.
    \item Automate the script for the payment gateway.
    \item Analyze risks through PM and successfully reduce risks.
    \item The app can process more than 5,000 transactions per day.
    \item Increased automation speed by 20\% in parallel tests
    \item Successful payment test coverage is 100\%.
\end{itemize}
